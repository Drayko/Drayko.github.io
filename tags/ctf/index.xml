      <description>&lt;p&gt;On Sunday, April 5th, there was an event for &lt;strong&gt;International Women&amp;rsquo;s Day&lt;/strong&gt;. Among other activities, there was a cybersecurity workshop.

I was ready! But then I found out we needed a virtual machine too, which a friend later shared with me. So I had to step out of the workshop.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Hey everyone! It&amp;rsquo;s been a while since my last post.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;This time, Iâ€™m kicking off a new series that will serve as both a practice guide and a follow-up to the GOAD WriteUp. We&amp;rsquo;ll go from reconnaissance all the way to gaining control and analyzing an &lt;strong&gt;Active Directory (AD)&lt;/strong&gt; infrastructure. Iâ€™ll mostly follow the same route but with some tweaks to reflect changes and sprinkle in some real-life experience from my work. I wonâ€™t go super deep into the technical detailsâ€”otherwise, Iâ€™d end up writing a book (or two! ðŸ˜„)â€”but Iâ€™ll include helpful resources if you want to dive deeper. And as always, the comments section is open! My goal here is to explain technical concepts in a clear and friendly way so that even beginners can follow along and learn.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;This post arose from a university job (for a Raspberry); however, it served me with other similar needs, to connect remotely without opening ports on the router.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>Taxonomy of DDoS Attacks and DDoS Defense Mechanisms</title>
      <link>https://drayko.github.io/post/taxonomy-of-ddos/</link>

      <description>&lt;blockquote&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;A Distributed Denial of Service (DDoS) attack is carried out by generating a large flow of information from multiple connection points towards a single destination. In this post, two types of taxonomies will be presented to classify them by attacks and countermeasures, highlighting similarities, characteristics, and strategies with the aim of designing appropriate measures.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Introduction&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;&#xA;The development and use of DDoS attack techniques have increased over time, and attackers constantly modify their approaches. This study aims to cover both well-known attacks and potential modifications, divided by levels.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

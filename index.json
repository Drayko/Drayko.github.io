I encountered and based in a project of Va5c0.\nIt often happens in a pentest or even more a bug bounty, that you need to enumerate targets or processes that take a lot of time as certain types of nmap scans, cracking some hash. And many times for that reason I leave that process working, checking if it is finished or not, leaving the computer on, sometimes with nothing else to do, sometimes I had to leave and turn off the computer leaving all the previous process without results. It is a high cost of time and money.\nSo now I share this little project of a bot (which I baptized as Bot Bounty) that can be used by a single person or several, as a company with this same need to improve productivity. Either on a computer, VPS, or a Raspberry. Keeping the degree of security that no one but the people who are authorized to use the bot will use it (in case someone external comes across the bot and try to use it).\nThe bot has predefined options for quick access to information that can be useful for bot usage. To mention a few: the available RAM space (info serv/RAM option), or the public IP of the device on which the bot is running.\nIn addition, with the command /exec you can execute any command that is available in our terminal of the device to use, for example:\nThus limiting itself to commands that require interaction, such as some unforced installation with the typical -y or logging in via SSH, to name a few examples.\nFor example, in amass, the command is /amassenum, which calls $ amass enum -d to perform an enumeration of subdomains:\nIn nmap we have a scan with the scripts, by default, pull out the port versions found, avoid performing host discovery (check if it is alive), and search all possible ports; i.e.: $ nmap -sC -sV -Pn -p-.\nOf course, to use these commands, the tools must be installed in the system you are using to run the bot (and you can call them directly in the console).\nAs a first release, we only have these commands; however, I am waiting for other shortcut commands to add to the bot that you suggest. Also, if you find bugs, you can write to me or issue an issue in the repository.\nThe repository is as follows: Bot Bounty\nPre-configurations To use it previously you must create a bot in Telegram and replace the API KEY that gives by the value specified in the script at line 12.\n1TOKEN = \u0026#39;XXXXXX:XXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXX\u0026#39;. In addition to register the user ID(s) that will use the bot, in line 14:\n1authorizedUsers = [123456789, 987654321] And now just run the script.\n1$ python3 bot.py Tips **If the command's output is too big, you should save it in a file and without output **.\nfor example:\n nmapadv example.com \u0026gt; resultsExample.txt nmapadv example.com -oN resultsExample.txt exec echo 'awesome bot!' \u0026gt; yesItIs.txt  To check for possible unauthorized users trying to use the bot, a log of all executed commands with user details is kept in the file logFileBot.txt.\nAnd that would be it, for now; I hope this work is well received.\n-Hackers are People Too 游땦\n","permalink":"https://drayko.github.io/post/bot-bounty-telegram-bot/","tags":["bot","featured","bug bounty","pentest","tool"],"title":"Bot Bounty, a bot for Pentesting \u0026 Bug Bounty"},{"categories":null,"contents":"Seven years ago I begin on security information.

Where some of the documented articles about the first computers in each country were listed, and discovering that Bolivia was on that list was interesting (the paper is among the ACM library).\nThe first computer, according to this article, is a IBM 1440 (as seen in the image), which the Bolivian Mining Corporation acquired (COMIBOL).\nThe article was published in 1969. It explains that the department created to use the machine had already been in operation for 3.5 years. So I deduce that the computer arrived in 1965 or 1966 (if anyone could confirm this, it would be incredible).\nHowever, the complicated thing at the beginning, as in almost any new equipment, was to find trained workers to use this machine. That was available for the accounting processes of the corporation, something that questioned the usefulness given the cost of the computer. So aptitude tests were made for its management, where 500 people applied, but only six passed. They sent these staff to be trained in COBOL and FORTRAN IV to do the data processing.\nAlthough it was a tremendous technological advance, there were still doubts about it and being criticized because the previous staff who carried out this accounting work by hand had to be practically fired.\nThe cost of technological advancement for specific jobs or careers continues to be devastating to this day due to the automation of processes and even more so when using \u0026quot;Artificial Intelligence\u0026quot; is already seen in so many areas that the human seems unnecessary.\nHowever, it is not the end of the road for everyone; it is the law of life and nature that the strongest or the one who adapts the fastest survives.

Traffic Analysis 1  Welcome. A company dedicated to banking has just hired you to perform traffic analysis. The problem is that there is an employee who is leaking email addresses, at the same time another employee started to pass passwords that have privileges to modify the salaries of employees. Your mission is to find that password.\n Well, to begin with, they give us a traffic capture, in which when we search with Wireshark we find a request with the username and password.\nthen the flag is:\n1007  1.2 Web crawlers  Unfortunately search engines are indexing many pages of this website that are confidential to us! Do you know which file prevents this from happening? Nobody wants fully indexed sites right?\n This is quite easy, the Flag is inside the robots.txt, which provides information to the search engine crawlers about the pages or files that they can request or not from your website.\n1http://url/robots.txt  1.3 Backups  Petr칩leos del Caribe asked us to save a backup of its main jsp file. Unfortunately, the engineer in charge went to a plant in the middle of the sea and he can't tell us the extension with which he saved them. The supply manager requires the backup urgently, can you help me identify which file it is in? Do it soon my position is at stake. Remember that the most common backup extensions are:\n bak old bakup save   In this one we had to be somewhat observant, as much in the track as in what we have in front of us, it tells us the main jsp, which would come to mean the index.jsp in addition that the current page is http://url/index.jsp.\nSo trying with the extensions that they suggest us, it is possible to arrive to the answer\n1http://url/index.jsp.bakup Which contains\n1\u0026lt;%@ page contentType=\u0026#34;text/html; charset=UTF-8\u0026#34; pageEncoding=\u0026#34;UTF-8\u0026#34; language=\u0026#34;java\u0026#34; import=\u0026#34;java.sql.*,java.io.*,java.net.*,org.owasp.encoder.Encode, dbProcs.*, utils.*\u0026#34; errorPage=\u0026#34;\u0026#34; %\u0026gt; 2\u0026lt;%@ page import=\u0026#34;java.util.Locale\u0026#34;%\u0026gt; 3\u0026lt;%@ include file=\u0026#34;translation.jsp\u0026#34; %\u0026gt; 4\u0026lt;% 5\tShepherdLogManager.logEvent(request.getRemoteAddr(), request.getHeader(\u0026#34;X-Forwarded-For\u0026#34;), \u0026#34;DEBUG: index.jsp *************************\u0026#34;); 6\tLocale lang = new Locale(Validate.validateLanguage(request.getSession())); 7/** 8The flag/flag is: 402051f4be0cc3aad33bcf3ac3d6532b. 9 */ 10%\u0026gt; then that's where we get the flag\n1402051f4be0cc3aad33bcf3ac3d6532b  1.4 Programmer program  One of your friends left you a clue in java code development, but you must solve a mathematical puzzle before you can find the result.

We are performing a traffic analysis because we detected that someone is leaking confidential information and the amount of information is so large that they compressed it with password protection, but finding the password is easy for you. Help us to find the password that will help us to access our flag. Download capture\n Finding the zip was not difficult, we only had to export it with Export Packet Bytes or exporting all the objects. Once arrived at this point the zip that we obtain is protected with a password as mentioned in the statement, for that, we had to observe the capture\nthe zip password\n1azulcrema and the flag!\n1IW{HTTP_BASIC_AUTH_IS_EASY}  3.2 User list  A group of users decided to complain because there is no coffee, can you believe it. And one of the users seems to be the one stealing the coffee, of course, he hid himself from the list. Help me find him and bring back the coffee to our lives.\n In this one it took me a while to realize, we were given a choice between consulting the information of 5 users, however, there was not something relevant among them, I tried to search by inspecting the elements, and the requests, however, the clue was in how the requests were made.\n1POST /challenges/vc9b78627df2c032ceaf7375df1d847e47ed7abac2a4ce4cb6086646e0f313a4 HTTP/1.1 2Host: 192.168.3.100 3Accept: ** 4Accept-Language: en-US,en:q-0.5 5Accept-Encoding: gzip, deflate 6Referer: https://192.168.3.100/challenges/vc9b78627df2c032ceaf7375df1d847e47ed7abac2a4ce4cb6086646eOf313a4.jsp 7Content-Type: application/X-WWW-form-urlencoded 8X-Requested-With: XMLHttpRequest 9Content-Length: 45 10Connection: close 11 12userId%5B%5D=cfcd208495d565ef66e7dff9f98764da The request was identified this way: cfcd208495d565ef66e7dff9f98764da, which when verified was an MD5 and in plain text value 0:\n1cfcd208495d565ef66e7dff9f98764da = 0 When checking the others, they worked the same way, so I generated a list of MD5 hashed numbers to make requests until I found the hidden user, which was no more than the number 20.\n 3.3 HASHDUMP  Find the admin password\n1sistemas:500:9E689B23C4D33D88E4C560258374B547:7E058F739B8A1E67C00815FC1E5E0E25::: 2Guest:501:NO PASSWORD*********************:NO PASSWORD*********************::: 3nonadmin:1005:NO PASSWORD*********************:0CF3760C0B0EB9F570AACE7040DF6DB7::: 4contabilidad:1013:23AC1B85C36D31AAE45E0AE1804A24B0:DE6D8B1780A4F0714242AC53A6C2B2E8::: 5administrador:1014:CE9F401800DF01AFFF959C003A9671D0:A7B9ECDD64AA492E449E0A619FD16E4B::: 6gerencia:1015:4978646A5C99C2834D6A97A372D4BC83:C7994B298128024418AD0E9C5038570C:::  We can see that it is a dump of the Windows (NTLM) hashes.\nThis one took a while to figure out the trick, at first glance one would think that the admin account would be the one with such a name or similar, however, the trick was in the RID. The 500 belongs to the administrator account created during the OS installation, although in this case it is called sistemas.\nThen we have 2 ways to find it by brute force/dictionary or to look for it, to save time better to look for it and so we have, the flag!\n1coldplay  Level 4 4.1 Cracking rar  The users of the insurance company SEGURITAS are driving the systems staff crazy with their famous changes. As if they were going to change the world. If you are clever you will be able to access the flag that is compressed and password protected A systems employee has a clue for you. His id from a popular social network is 0x5afa18273c14.\n Download   First the id must be converted from Hexadecimal, then we get: 100030193548308.\nNow in facebook, we look for the profile: https://www.facebook.com/100030193548308 in which we find pictures of the employee spreading critical information about the company like that for rar files the password must have a number of length 5, then the only thing left is to crack the rar with a dictionary with all the possibilities of 5 digits numerals with John The Ripper.\n1john --wordlist=six --format=rar5 hashrar hashrar is the file where the hash of the RAR is located, then, we have the password.\n160372 With this we can extract the flag inside the archive:\n18743b52063cd84097a65d1633f5c74f5  4.2 Website bank  To complete this challenge you must create a bank account and transfer more than 10000 bs to it. When you have that amount in your bank account, simply log out and log in again to be rewarded with the flag.\n To start with you have to register, and the platform gives us the possibility to transfer money to other accounts\nHowever intercepting the requests was insecure, similar to this:\n1accountSource=4\u0026amp;accountDestination=2\u0026amp;amount=1200 so by modifying the request, we can reverse this\n1accountSource=2\u0026amp;accountTarget=4\u0026amp;amount=1200 this way we transfer money to ourselves, here is the result:\nVoila!\n10738FF78AE98A11F579A70F3F98468097426D4652B32A5F978818FC9CCB66CE74371A28833CC1A52854697C734D66249DB8E9AAB67F024262436EC8220C9OF11  Level 5 5.1 Exploiting  We are doing safe development, Your challenge is to change the flow of the program so that the hidden function executes.

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Hey everyone! It&amp;rsquo;s been a while since my last post.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;This time, I‚Äôm kicking off a new series that will serve as both a practice guide and a follow-up to the GOAD WriteUp. We&amp;rsquo;ll go from reconnaissance all the way to gaining control and analyzing an &lt;strong&gt;Active Directory (AD)&lt;/strong&gt; infrastructure. I‚Äôll mostly follow the same route but with some tweaks to reflect changes and sprinkle in some real-life experience from my work. I won‚Äôt go super deep into the technical details‚Äîotherwise, I‚Äôd end up writing a book (or two! üòÑ)‚Äîbut I‚Äôll include helpful resources if you want to dive deeper. And as always, the comments section is open! My goal here is to explain technical concepts in a clear and friendly way so that even beginners can follow along and learn.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;On Sunday, April 5th, there was an event for &lt;strong&gt;International Women&amp;rsquo;s Day&lt;/strong&gt;. Among other activities, there was a cybersecurity workshop. And well, I kinda sneaked in üòú. The workshop had some requirements like having Kali Linux installed. Luckily, I had my laptop and my phone (yep, Kali on both‚Äîdouble the fun üíÅ‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è). I was ready! But then I found out we needed a virtual machine too, which a friend later shared with me. So I had to step out of the workshop.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;This post arose from a university job (for a Raspberry); however, it served me with other similar needs, to connect remotely without opening ports on the router.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>Taxonomy of DDoS Attacks and DDoS Defense Mechanisms</title>
      <link>https://drayko.github.io/post/taxonomy-of-ddos/</link>

      <description>&lt;blockquote&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;A Distributed Denial of Service (DDoS) attack is carried out by generating a large flow of information from multiple connection points towards a single destination. In this post, two types of taxonomies will be presented to classify them by attacks and countermeasures, highlighting similarities, characteristics, and strategies with the aim of designing appropriate measures.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Introduction&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;&#xA;The development and use of DDoS attack techniques have increased over time, and attackers constantly modify their approaches. This study aims to cover both well-known attacks and potential modifications, divided by levels.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Although this post is not something technical as usual, I find it quite interesting about the first computer in Bolivia.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

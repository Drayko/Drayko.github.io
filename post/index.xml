      <description>&lt;blockquote&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;A Distributed Denial of Service (DDoS) attack is carried out by generating a large flow of information from multiple connection points towards a single destination. In this post, two types of taxonomies will be presented to classify them by attacks and countermeasures, highlighting similarities, characteristics, and strategies with the aim of designing appropriate measures.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Introduction&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;&#xA;The development and use of DDoS attack techniques have increased over time, and attackers constantly modify their approaches. This study aims to cover both well-known attacks and potential modifications, divided by levels.&lt;/p&gt;</description>
